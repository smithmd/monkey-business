Monkey Business - A game about clicking monkeys as they jump at you.. or something... that involves monkeys


Game Basics
-----------

+ Bananas are in-game currency used to purchase upgrades.
    + Bananas are collected from monkeys that come out of the barrel.
    + Bananas can be stolen by monkeys reaching out of the barrel.
    + Amount of Bananas received depends on the type of monkey that comes out of the barrel.


* Monkeys are inside the barrel, clicking/knocking on the barrel gets them to come out.
    * Players can upgrade/promote Monkeys up the corporate ladder
        * Promotions cost more bananas the higher up the ladder.
        * Demotions can occur if the monkey throws poop at the player?
    * The higher up the ladder, the more Bananas the player steals from the monkeys that come out of the barrel.
    * Monkeys can throw poop.  Poop does something, maybe causes a demotion that will decrease Bananas received.
    * Monkeys can grab/steal your Bananas while they are in the barrel.


* Barrels contain the Monkeys.  Knocking on it, drives the Monkeys out of the barrel.
    * Barrels can be temporarily upgraded with woodpeckers that knock on the barrel for the player.
        * Woodpeckers last until their beak breaks.
        * Upgraded Woodpeckers have stronger beaks that last longer.


* The scene is an Office/Jungle hybrid.
    * The barrel is in the middle of the screen.
        * Barrel position will allow the monkey to reach outside and grab/steal some bananas.
    * The score/bananas will be a number, possibly with a representative pile of bananas.
    * File Cabinets will be along the outside of the screen and will contain upgrades.
        * Left Cabinets for Monkey Upgrades?
        * Right Cabinets for Barrel Upgrades?
        * Clicking on Cabinets opens up overlay menu?


* The Game
    * Players can save/continue games.
    * Never ends.
    * Achievements!
        * Players will unlock various achievements, hopefully funny.. probably based on pop culture.
          We might need to re-watch: King Kong, Planet of the Apes, Curious George, etc.
        * Possible Achievements:
            * "Damn Dirty Apes": Have X amount of poop thrown at player.
            * "The Yellow Hat": An impossibly random Monkey is dressed in yellow and wearing a hat.
            * "Banana Grabber": Have X amount of bananas stole from player. (would be awesome to have the
               Arrested Development theme song play... the short one on the Yuke or whatever.)
        * Since players can continue progress, a leader board might be fun and encourage players to return.
          This would also allow for a "Top Banana" achievement.
    * Events!
        * Things can happen?  This needs to be flushed out to see what we want.
    * Upgrades!
        * Better/More expensive as time goes on.


Game Play Basics
----------------

The player clicks on the barrel to get monkeys to come out.  As the monkey leaves the barrel, the player gets
that monkey's bananas.

The player uses bananas to upgrade both the monkeys and the barrel.

Monkey upgrades serve to "promote" the monkey coming out of the barrel, thus making them more fancy and giving
them more bananas.

Barrel upgrades enable a temporary "auto-clicker" in the form of a Woodpecker, whose beak will eventually break.
